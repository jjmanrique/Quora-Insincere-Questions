# Quora Insincere Questions

Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, has been an active research
field for more than 50 years. It is defined as the automatic manipulation of
natural language, speech or text, by software.

In this project, I created a Neural Network Model to identify insincere questions - those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement
rather than look for helpful answers - on the website Quora, that provided the
dataset on a Kaggle competition.

The project is divided in two notebooks: <i>Quora kernel</i> shows the preprocessing and training phase. <i>Analysis</i> one shows posterior analysis on the predicted results and the whole data.
